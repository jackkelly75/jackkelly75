Currently, I am a data scientist at Bet365 with a particular interest in applications of machine and deep learning to big data.

I have previously worked on applications of machine learning and causal inference to build large scale -omics networks and acted as the consultant statistician for the Manchester University Centre for Audiology and Deafness. I have experience collaborating on large projects with many researchers and handling a wide variety of health data types and methodologies.

My PhD was in applications of machine learning to identify blood biomarkers of neurodegenerative disease.
