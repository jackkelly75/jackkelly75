I have an interest in applications of causal inference to biological networks to better understand large scale omics data and analysis of high throughput data with applications to complex diseases. Much of my  research  has  been  on  neurodegenerative  disease  and hypertension in  particular,  and  I have used  a  broad range of different bioinformatics techniques to produce novel and exciting results. 

Currently, using genomic and transcriptomic data I have been developing an approach expanding on MR using machine learning to build molecular causal networks of hypertension, in order to elucidate the complex biological mechanisms that underlie this disease. 

Additionally, I am the consultant statistician for the Manchester University Centre for Audiology and Deafness. I have experience collaborating on large projects with many researchers and handling a wide variety of health data types and methodologies.
